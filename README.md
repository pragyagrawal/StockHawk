# Stock Hawk
Stock Hawk app was done as part of udacity android devloper nanodegree course, this application queries yahoo finance api
to find stock prices for NASDAQ stocks, we get there high low information for day and information about daily trends and 
monthly trends of a stock, this is then represented in nice graphs. User can also add stock widget on there home screen. 

This app helped me in understanding concepts like widgets, graphs in android, async tasks, network communication, parsing data in json
and material design basics.
